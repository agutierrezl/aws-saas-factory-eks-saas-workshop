# SaaS Factory SaaS EKS Workshop

The code provided here is intended to accompany the SaaS Factory EKS Workshop. The workshop is a series of hands-on labs through which participants build up, step-by-step, a functioning multi-tenant EKS environment. This workshop explores key architectural strategies that are used to address the various key tenets of SaaS solutions including isolation, identity, data partitioning, routing, deployment, and operational considerations and specifically how these are realized in EKS. Once complete with this workshop, participants will have a better understanding of the EKS-flavor of multi-tenancy, and be better able to understand the EKS SaaS reference solution, also produced by the SaaS Factory team.
